# about-me-responsive

For this assignment I created an about me page with two HTML pages linked together.

During my tutor session on Friday I was made aware that we only use a single CSS file even with multiple HTML pages. I didnt want to modify this repo incase I broke 
everything but I am going to try and merge the CSS into a single file.
